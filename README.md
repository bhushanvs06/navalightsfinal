## **Features**  <br/>  
### **1) AI Test**  <br/>  
Our AI asks user-friendly questions about their interests and suggests a suitable career path based on their responses.  <br/>  
This feature helps users understand themselves better and choose a career that aligns with their interests.  <br/>  

The AI test covers various topics, including:  <br/>  
- **Popular Games** – Minecraft, BGMI, Free Fire, GTA 5, etc.  <br/>  
- **Popular Sports** – Football (Soccer), Basketball, Cricket, Tennis, Badminton, Athletics, Swimming, etc.  <br/>  
- **Creative Fields** – Animator, Graphic Designer, Video Editor, etc.  <br/>

### **2) Mentor Connect**  <br/>  
Mentor Connect offers two options:  <br/>  

1. **AI Mentor**  <br/>  
   - Provides a detailed description of the selected career path.  <br/>  
   - Answers career-related queries, including:  <br/>  
     - Steps to pursue a career  <br/>  
     - Entrance exams and admission processes  <br/>  
     - Resources for preparation  <br/>  
   - The AI mentor responds using a dataset covering career paths such as:  <br/>  
     - **Graphics Designer, Animator, Gamer, Content Creator, Video Editor**  <br/>  

2. **Human Expert**  <br/>  
   - Connects users with professional mentors via video calls (Google Meet).  <br/>  
   - Users can directly interact with experts to seek career guidance.  <br/>  
   - If a mentor is online, a meeting link is displayed upon request.  <br/>

### **3) Planner**  <br/>  
Once users identify their interests and have background knowledge about their chosen career, the Planner feature provides:  <br/>  
- A structured **roadmap** for their career journey.  <br/>  
- **YouTube reference links** to help users get started.  <br/>  

This ensures that users have a clear, step-by-step guide to follow their aspirations effectively.  <br/>
